## Advanced TensorFlow Example

This repository now includes a small TensorFlow.js demonstration in
`advanced_tf.js`. It shows how to train a neural network with the Adam
optimizer using matrix based operations and then feeds the predictions
into a simple Bayesian update loop.

Run it with:

```bash
node advanced_tf.js
```

The script assumes `@tensorflow/tfjs-node` is installed in the local
environment.
